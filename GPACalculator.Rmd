This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#this is a GPA calculator and Converter. 
  #it will calculate the cumulative GPA and Undergrad Major GPA from a CSV file. 
    # I made it because York has a strange, linear GPA measurement and it was hard to tell what my 4.0 GPA would look from my 9.0 gpa.

#import the Data
data_gpa <- read_csv("data/GPA_data.csv")
#calculate the weighted mean GPA for 9.0 grades

#subset the data for just data from my undergrad major (which equals 2 in this csv file)

#calculate weighted mean for just undergraduate major.

#this will convert all the grades into a the 4.0 system

                                          GradePoints == 8 ~ 3.8,
                                          GradePoints == 7 ~ 3.3,

#technically no need to do this, but most GPA weighting systems are based around a value of 1.0 rather than 6.00 so I changed those as well for good measure.

#Weighted mean in 4.0 format for cumulative GPA

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
